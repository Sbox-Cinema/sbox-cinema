# Contributing to S&Box Cinema

Thanks for contributing!
The goal of this file is to help you better contribute to the S&Box Cinema project!

## Touch only relevant code

If you are submitting changes that add a new gun, don't include code changes that change the color of a UI element.

## Stick to one feature at a time

To the best of your ability, include only one feature change in a branch.

## Avoid mega branches

Instead of merging a bunch of your branches together, submit PR's for each one.

## Keep code consistent

General code formatting should follow the `.editorconfig` in the repo and the `STYLE.md` file.

Try to keep code files consistent in style and convention, if you're working in an existing file, follow how that file does things.

## Submit a PR whenever your feature is ready

When you think your feature is done, create a PR so it can be reviewed.
