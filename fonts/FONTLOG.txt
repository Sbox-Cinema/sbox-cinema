Basic Font Information

A fresh decorative geometric grotesque with a hint of 
Art Deco and c‘onstructivism. Poiret One is a unique 
typeface with light forms and pure elegance. Sleek and 
simple. Based on geometric forms, it has stylish lines 
and graceful curves. The font is applicable for large 
signs, labels, titles, headlines and any type of graphic 
design on the web, in motion graphics, or in print - 
from t-shirts to posters and logos.

where style is desired. Complete with a lower-case
